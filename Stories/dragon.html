            <p> air hung thick with smoke and the tang of metal. Ember, scales the color of burnished copper gleaming, landed heavily on the crumbling battlement. Below, the human army swarmed, ants against the ravaged landscape. Beside her, Onyx, his obsidian scales reflecting the fires raging in the distance, snarled.</p>

            <p>"They shouldn't have taken the egg," Onyx growled, his voice a low rumble.</p>
            
            <p> nodded, her throat tight. The stolen egg, emerald green flecked with gold, belonged to Willow, the gentlest dragon Ember knew. Its loss had ripped through their mountaintop aerie like a hurricane.</p>
            
            <p>"We fight for Willow," Ember declared, her voice echoing with the ancient power of their kind.</p>
            
            <p>With a roar that shook the very foundations of the human city, the dragons attacked. Ember swooped down, flames erupting from her nostrils, incinerating siege weapons and scattering soldiers like chaff. Onyx, a whirlwind of teeth and claws, tore through their ranks.</p>
            
            <p>the humans, for all their fragility, were persistent. Arrows, tipped with dragonbone and imbued with forgotten magics, rained down on Ember's scales. One found its mark, piercing the tender flesh beneath her wing. She roared in pain, the wind knocked from her lungs.</p>
            
            <p>She landed heavily, flames licking at the edges of her vision. A shadow fell over her. A human knight, clad in black iron, his sword glowing with an eerie green light, stood before her. He raised his weapon, a triumphant gleam in his eye.</p>

            <p> A high-pitched screech split the air. From the heart of the city, cradled in the arms of a young woman, a small dragon hatchling, emerald green and flecked with gold, cried out.</p>
            
            <p>The knight hesitated, his gaze flickering from the hatchling to Ember. Then, with a sigh, he lowered his sword.</p>
            
            <p>"Take your young," he said, his voice rough. "And leave this place. We will not pursue."</p>
            
            <p>Ember, weak and wounded, could only nod. Onyx landed beside her, his eyes wide with surprise. Gently, Ember nudged him towards the city. With a growl that held more of a rumble than a threat, Onyx obeyed.</p>
            
            <p>The humans parted as Onyx approached the woman and the hatchling. The woman, her face streaked with soot and tears, held out the baby dragon. Onyx nudged it gently with his snout, then lifted his head and roared, a sound filled with both sorrow and relief.</p>
            
            <p>Ember, her wing throbbing, watched as Onyx, the hatchling safely nestled against his chest, soared into the sky. Her heart ached, but beneath the pain, a seed of hope bloomed. The humans had taken something precious, but they had also shown unexpected mercy. Perhaps, she dared to hope, they could learn to share the world, instead of fighting for it.</p>
            
            <p>With a final glance at the ravaged city, Ember spread her wings and followed her kin, leaving the fires and the fighting behind. The future was uncertain, but as long as even one dragon egg hatched, there was always hope for peace.</p>
